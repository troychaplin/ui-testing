    'Audio plays a vital role in conveying emotions, dialogue, and sound effects in animations. However, individuals with hearing impairments or those who are deaf may struggle to fully comprehend the auditory elements. To address this, it is essential to include accurate closed captions or subtitles that effectively represent the dialogue and sound effects. These captions should be synchronized with the animation and presented in a clear and easily readable format, ensuring accessibility for all viewers. To learn more about the differencen between captions and subtitles and why we use them, check out our blogpost titled Captivating Captions: Why We Use Captions on Video. Additionally, we have a great tutorial on Generating Transcripts and Closed Captioning from YouTube Videos.',
